# 03 Javascript: Password Generator

## About

This homework was to build a password generator. The user is prompted to select its criteria



>* Choose pass word length of atleast 8 but no more than 128 characters
>* (Must choose atleast one of the following to include)
>* Lower case letters
>* Upper case letters
>* Numbers
>* Special Characters

While chosing criteria for the password, the function pushes one character from chosen array into the password, fills to desired length from chosen arrays, and then shuffles the passwrod before printing to the HTML document
